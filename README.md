As the 2nd line says Poping your own cherry and just jumping in is the only way to conquer your own unkown abilities, not afraid to fail or accidental destroy processes Everythings fixable and or repairable
As I probably dont speak in code etiquete or verbose lingo, I've been leary to what i say , but that's judt holding e back, IMO, So I call it like I see it, Or speak in no code lol... Started this to learn how to implement Coinbase API, and API's in general... Personally, we've waited for 20 years for the AR/VR to come to life, and if you think about how absolutely FANTASTIC this can and will be, New Ventures, More Time to find something that makes you want to keep it floored, helping and educating yourself out of passion insted of Stipulations and Frustrations will lead to more openess and people wanting to help their fellow brothers and sisters achieve the same solace and prosperity. Common sense left earth Mid 90s for most, Logic was soon to dissapear, Thank god it hasnt YET... Come Hell or highwater, I see things alittle/alot differently than I did 5-10yrs. ago, but always looked from the outside in , that may be the difference.. but i will make myself fluid and capable of whatever i want to accomplish and with all the endless posibilities at your fingertips 24 hours a day, you must take advantage of whats in front of you and change your mindset to adpt to the Intelligent revolution of THOUGHTS and IDEAS... If you can't see the A.I. in your daily life, YOU'RE BLIND, or in DENILE.. Or you just think "thats so far off..." NOPE IT's here and IT isn't leaving, Intelligence is in you, you either supress it and think like nothing is ever right, or embrace what your thoughts tell you and pursue what you perceve to be there and make your on way! If you can't comprehend that intellegence is within you, LOOK around you at anything that/s NATURAL, 100% of Everything in Nature is and will always be developed NATURALLY with the "GOLDEN RATIO" from Plants, bugs, Trees, to You and I. Off to go GIT mine , feel ree to say Hi, Be Blessed, smile, and Blast some Tunes!
